Feature: Manage Exam Questions Functionality
  As a lecturer
  I want to manage exam questions
  So that I can add, edit, or delete questions for my exams

  Scenario: Lecturer successfully adds a new question
    Given The lecturer has selected an existing exam with id "851e51bc-ed0a-4abd-868a-6f4a1d413aa0"
    When The lecturer clicks the "Tambahkan Soal" button
    Then The system redirects the lecturer to the new question page for exam "851e51bc-ed0a-4abd-868a-6f4a1d413aa0"
    When The lecturer fills in the question, answer key, and maximum score fields
    And Clicks the "Simpan" button
    Then The system displays the message "success create question"
    And The system redirects the lecturer to the exam page "851e51bc-ed0a-4abd-868a-6f4a1d413aa0"

  Scenario: Lecturer fails to add a question due to invalid input
